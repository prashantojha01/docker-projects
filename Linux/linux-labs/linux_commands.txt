##Creating a new user and adding it to the sudoers list
useradd john
passwd john
cat /etc/group
visudo  ##(it will open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config file) 

###add below root 
john    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

###now save and quit
service sshd restart

###now login using john

####then you can use sudo -i to become root, if we do not add john to the admin group we cannot be sudo user
###as it will give error that john is not in the sudoers list.

###The user initially created on azure will not be on the sudoers list since it is managed by azure using some arm template so that if u forget
###the password u can reset it on azure.

cat /etc/group
gpasswd -d jerry docker (remove jerry from docker group)

###To check how many users are there in a group:
getent group <group-name>

## Change ownership of the file
chown username:groupname filename

##The ownership of any file in the system may only be altered by a root user. A user cannot give away ownership of a file, 
##even when the user owns it. Similarly, only a member of a group can change a file's group ID to that group.
